# Go-BLS Signature Aggregation

This repository is a go-wrapper around @herumi's BLS implementation using the underlying [herumi/mcl](https://github.com/herumi/mcl) cryptography library written in C++. The go wrapper is also based on @herumi's original BLS C++ project [herumi/bls](https://github.com/herumi/bls).
